# Artyom, HTML5 voice assistant

## Presentation

This plugin allows to integrate Artyom on the Jeedom dashboard and therefore voice recognition on Jeedom web pages

Please note, Artyom uses underlying functions of Chrome and therefore only works in this browser (including Android version)

Speech recognition is then used with the Jeedom interactions engine directly and the feedback read by the plugin


## Configuration

The plugin has no general configuration

It is necessary to create an equipment which will be used to place the widget where we want on the dashboard but also to configure the trigger keyword and the language


## FAQ

Yes it uses Google Speech Recognition and Google Speech Synthetiser underlying the functions of Chrome.

## Troubleshooting
